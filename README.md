# CodeXam
CodeXam is a simple application built on .NET platform using C# to conduct a coding exam at small level. As no server is needed.

OLEDb connection connection is used to pull Questions, Test data and results, username and password from the mdb files present in %userprofile%/CodeXam/   .

Password for those database file is "iamtheone".

The coding style could be very bad because I am an amature.


Features:
1.    Currently only JAVA is implemeneted. But implementending other languages is not tough It's in the "compile" class.
2.    A user cannot cheat the time limit even by restaring application, until he knows the password and address of database file.
3.    Even after restarting the app will start from same state.
